                            As you know, we support young people who are passionate about programming and teach them the finer details of it. First, we took a practical lesson and raised the potential of self-belief. Also, by getting a successful result, we have already gathered attention and proved that this hypothesis is correct and good. We conducted our first experience with 7th grade students at school number 171. We set 3 conditions that are important for us to get a successful result.  
                            1. We must be disciplined 
                            2. We must not be excited
                            3. We must trust each other. 
                            We must be disciplined, because if we are disciplined, the students in front of us can take us seriously.  For this, we arrived at the school at 8 o'clock on October 31, turned on the computers until the children arrived.  When they came and sat in the classroom, we were ready and waiting for them.  
                            We shouldn't be excited, because if we were excited, we wouldn't get the results we wanted, we might forget everything and not live up to our expectations.  We managed to do this, we tried our best to reduce the excitement both in ourselves and in the children, we were sincere with them, we learned their names.  This sincerity that we gave them ensured that the lesson went smoothly.
                            And finally trusting each other.  If we made the children feel this insecurity, they would not believe us and the comfort of the lesson would be disturbed.  That's why we didn't think that our other group mate would make a mistake or not be able to explain.  
                            We recommend these 3 conditions to everyone who wants to be successful in any field, we are sure that they will be more successful.

                                We first introduced the children to ADA University. As you know, ADA University is the most prestigious university in Azerbaijan. At ADA University, which cooperates with many foreign universities, thousands of local and foreign students receive higher education in their field, and the employment rate of students who graduate from the university is 83 percent. The fact that the children knew that we were students of that university motivated them both to learn and to teach us better. Also, several children said that they dream of studying at ADA university in the future.

                                The Main Part of the Lesson

                            <p>
                                Later, we explained to the children in detail how to work on the codeorg website. Some children told us that they learned how to work from computer science classes, and some from competitions. We asked them what methods they used to learn it, because it could be any new method for us. During the lesson, we answered their questions and showed them how to solve the problems they were struggling with. And we gave a certificate to every student who finished the site.

                            <p>
                                Finally, after giving the certificates, we took a commemorative photo with the children and received their feedback. Feedbacks would help us to improve further. Every student's feedback was positive and they asked us to come back and continue their coding lessons. Of course, we felt very good because we were together with them, we had unforgettable moments. It was our first such experience, how could we forget?
